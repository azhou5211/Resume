	                    <p>Fascinated in data science to produce accurate predictions.<br></p>

						<p>I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in M.S. of Data Science. Before graduating from University of Washington, I went to Rutgers University â€“ New Brunswick with dual major in Computer Science and Statistics. From my academic background, I have obtained strong experience in data mining, data cleaning, and machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.<br></p>

						<p>Before graduating from University of Washington, I worked at The Clorox Company as a data science intern. At my time at The Clorox Company, I worked on two projects: Multi-Touch Attribution Model and The Voice of Consumer. The Multi-Touch Attribution Model is a model that generates an importance score on different AD platforms along the customer journey. The model helped the marketing team optimize their marketing spend on the most important AD platforms and save money on underperforming platforms. The second project, The Voice of Consumer, was an anomaly detection and diagnostics system. I focused on the diagnostics system when an anomaly in reviews and actions suddenly dipped or spiked. My diagnostics system would dissect the anomaly alert and give our marketing team critical information on why an anomaly has appeared and how to take action when an anomaly is detected.</p>
