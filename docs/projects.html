			    <h4 class="card-title">Evaluating the Robustness of Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems against Attacks</h4>
			    <p class="card-text">Our goal is to analyze the five shilling attack methods: Random Attack, Average Attack, Bandwagon Attack, Segmented Attack, Sampling Attack on different recommender systems. Recommender models chosen for evaluation are: User-based KNN model, Item-based KNN model, Latent Factor model, Neural Matrix Factorization model<br>
			    	- Implemented functions for Random Attack, Sampling Attack, and Segmented attack<br>
			    	- Implemented Neural Matrix Factorization model and trained on different attacked data sets<br>
			    	- Discovered KNN and Latent Facor recommender systems are more vunerable; Neural Matrix Factorization is the most robust against attacks

			    <p class="card-text">
			    	A project that can train people to learn correct postures for sports. This project uses computer vision to learn the correct postures from a professional sports player. A student can try to mimic the professional sports player's movement, and the program will give a score for how well they performed in comparison.<br>
			    	- Built front-end flask app to upload trainer video and watch students live<br>
			    	- Extracted human body positions using mediapipe<br>
			    	- Implemented and refactored functions to recognize poses from trainers and students

			    <p class="card-text">Recipe recommender for Meal Planning based on nutrition and available ingredients. <br>- Developed end-to-end Multi-Touch Attribution Model to attribute credit to marketing campaigns for a customer purchase<br>
- Designed modules to query data, clean the data, model the data, and generate a visualization for the user <br>
- Saved marketing spending on underperforming marketing campaigns while maintaining optimal customer purchase <br>
- Designed and developed a trend anomaly diagnostics system which assisted in understanding how and why an anomaly occurred; enabling users to interpret and take action when facing a detected trend anomaly alert

			    <p class="card-text">
			    	Find which government policies were the most effective at slowing down COVID-19 cases<br>
- Searched and scraped data online regarding COVID-19 cases and government policies implemented in the United States<br>
- Cleaned the data into a usable format for machine learning algorithms by using Pandas package from Python<br>
- Analyzed government policies from generated auto-regression time series and SAS JMP graphic visualizations and removed nonimpactful
government policies from the regression<br>
- Discovered the most impactful government policies were mask mandates and gathering restrictions of any size
